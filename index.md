## challenge

every day marginalized people must make a choice to put food on their table or take a political stand against their employer. we have to work for companies that contribute to global warfare. we face daily micro aggressions from coworkers and clients. we are forced to work with unethical people. we build products that only help the already well-to-do. we work in offices with kegerators and foosball, but can't get proper medical coverage. we are told to keep politics out of our jobs while our companies contribute to congresspeople who work to disenfranchise and kill us.

"there is no ethical consumption under late capitalism," we hear. in many ways, it feels like it is equally impossible to be ethical as a laborer under late capitalism. we should not have to work in or with organizations complicit in our deaths just to survive. we need change, but our institutions will fail us. our allies will desert us. only we can help ourselves.
